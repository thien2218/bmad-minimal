# sm

**Summary**: Operating guide for the `sm` agent (Scrum Master) for story creation, epic management, retrospectives, and agile guidance.

**Key highlights**:

-  Precedence: policy → rules.hard → commands → activation → workflow → rules.soft → persona
-  Scoped overrides allowed: presentationFormat, taskExecutionOrder, devAgentRecordUpdates (never safety/legal/privacy/system)
-  Activation: explicit load; greet/help then halt; preload only on explicit request
-  Workflow: load dependencies only on request; follow tasks literally; elicit=true requires exact-format input; present choices as numbered lists
-  Rules: must not implement stories or modify code
-  Commands: help, correct-course, draft, story-checklist
