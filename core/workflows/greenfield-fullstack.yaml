      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
        - market_research_prompt
      notes: "Can do brainstorming first, then optional deep research before creating project brief. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's {config.docsLocation}/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Creates PRD from project brief using prd-tmpl. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's {config.docsLocation}/ folder."

      creates: front-end-spec.md
      requires: prd.md
      optional_steps:
        - user_research_prompt
      notes: "Creates UI/UX specification using front-end-spec-tmpl. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-spec.md to your project's {config.docsLocation}/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: v0_prompt (optional)
      requires: front-end-spec.md
      condition: user_wants_ai_generation
      notes: "OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: Generate AI UI prompt for tools like v0, Lovable, etc. Use the generate-ai-frontend-prompt task. User can then generate UI in external tool and download project structure."

    - agent: architect
      creates: fullstack-architecture.md
      requires:
        - prd.md

        - technical_research_prompt
        - review_generated_ui_structure
      notes: "Creates comprehensive architecture using fullstack-architecture-tmpl. If user generated UI with v0/Lovable, can incorporate the project structure into architecture. May suggest changes to PRD stories or new stories. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final fullstack-architecture.md to your project's {config.docsLocation}/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      updates: prd.md (if needed)
      requires: fullstack-architecture.md

      uses: pd-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for consistency and completeness. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PDM finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to {config.docsLocation}/ folder."

    - project_setup_guidance:
      action: guide_project_structure
      condition: user_has_generated_ui
      notes: "If user generated UI with v0/Lovable: For polyrepo setup, place downloaded project in separate frontend repo alongside backend repo. For monorepo, place in apps/web or packages/frontend directory. Review architecture document for specific guidance."

    - development_order_guidance:
      action: guide_development_sequence
      notes: "Based on PRD stories: If stories are frontend-heavy, start with frontend project/directory first. If backend-heavy or API-first, start with backend. For tightly coupled features, follow story sequence in monorepo setup. Reference sharded architecture and frontend-architecture docs for development order."

      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Use md-tree: md-tree explode {config.docsLocation}/architecture.md {config.docsLocation}/architecture
        - Use md-tree: md-tree explode {config.docsLocation}/frontend-architecture.md {config.docsLocation}/frontend-architecture
        - Creates {config.docsLocation}/architecture/ and {config.docsLocation}/frontend-architecture/ folders with sharded content

      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items
      notes: |
        If QA left unchecked items:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address remaining items
        - Return to QA for final approval

    - repeat_development_cycle:
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (PDM → Dev → QA) for all epic stories
        Continue until all stories in PRD are complete
