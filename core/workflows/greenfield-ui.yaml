      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
        - market_research_prompt
      notes: "Can do brainstorming first, then optional deep research before creating project brief. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's {config.docs.root} folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Creates PRD from project brief using prd-tmpl, focused on UI/frontend requirements. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's {config.docs.root} folder."

      requires: frontend-spec.md
      condition: user_wants_ai_generation
      notes: "OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: Generate AI UI prompt for tools like v0, Lovable, etc. Use the generate-ai-frontend-prompt task. User can then generate UI in external tool and download project structure."

      optional_steps:
        - technical_research_prompt

    - agent: pdm
      action: shard_documents
      creates: sharded_docs
      requires: all_artifacts_in_project
      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Use md-tree: md-tree explode {config.docs.files.architecture} {config.docs.paths.architecture}

      notes: |
        Dev Agent (New Chat): @dev
        - Implements approved story
        - Updates File List with all changes
        - Marks story as "Review" when complete

    - agent: qa
      action: review_implementation
      updates: implementation_files
      requires: implementation_files
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat): @qa → review-story
        - Advisory review
        - Leaves prioritized checklist for Dev
        - Recommends status (owner decides)

    - agent: dev
      action: address_qa_feedback
      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items
      notes: |
        If QA left unchecked items:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address remaining items
        - Return to QA for final approval

    - repeat_development_cycle:
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (PDM → Dev → QA) for all epic stories
        Continue until all stories in PRD are complete

        OPTIONAL: After epic completion
        - NOTE: epic-retrospective task coming soon
        - Validate epic was completed correctly
        - Document learnings and improvements

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Building production frontend applications
      - Multiple views/pages with complex interactions
      - Need comprehensive UI/UX design and testing
      - Multiple team members will be involved
      - Long-term maintenance expected
      - Customer-facing applications
