  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Building production APIs or microservices
      - Multiple endpoints and complex business logic
      - Need comprehensive documentation and testing
      - Multiple team members will be involved
      - Long-term maintenance expected
      - Enterprise or external-facing APIs
