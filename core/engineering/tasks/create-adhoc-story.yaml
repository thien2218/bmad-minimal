agent: pdm

inputs:
   optional:
      - name: epic_enhancement_number

              PRD Impact:
              - Update relevant sections (scope, requirements, constraints) if behavior or requirements change

              Architecture Impact:
              - Update affected files/sections if component responsibilities, data models, APIs, or patterns are affected

              Options:
              1. No impact on PRD or Architecture
              2. PRD impact only
              3. Architecture impact only
              4. Both PRD and Architecture impact

            - Record a brief note in the story YAML under dev_notes.doc_impact_summary summarizing documentation updates
