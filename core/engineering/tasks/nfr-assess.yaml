        - Performance targets (response times, throughput)
        - Security requirements (auth methods, validation)
        - Reliability targets (uptime, error rates)
        - Maintainability targets (test coverage, documentation)

        Status Rules:
        - PASS: Meets response time targets, no bottlenecks, reasonable usage
        - CONCERNS: Close to limits, missing indexes, no caching strategy

           security:
              status: CONCERNS
              notes: "No rate limiting on auth endpoints"
           performance:
              status: PASS
              notes: "Response times < 200ms verified"
           reliability:
              status: PASS
              notes: "Error handling and retries implemented"
           maintainability:
              status: CONCERNS
              notes: "Test coverage at 65%, target is 80%"

        Generate ONLY for NFRs actually assessed (no placeholders).

        Use custom weights from @{docs.files.codingStandards} if available.
