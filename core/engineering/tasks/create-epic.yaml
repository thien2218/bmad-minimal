           prompt: |
              Before creating the epic, analyze:
              - PRD epic list and goals
              - Initiative scope and requirements
              - Architecture constraints and dependencies
              - Success criteria and acceptance thresholds

           prompt: |
              Validate that:
              - Epic is listed in the PRD epic list

              - Epic can be completed in reasonable number of stories
              - Dependencies and constraints are understood

              If any of these are false, recommend reviewing the PRD first
