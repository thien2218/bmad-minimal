title: Product Development Master Checklist
purpose: Validate project plans before execution across project types.
agent: pdm
context:
  notes: Detect project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and UI scope; skip items not applicable and note skips.
init_instructions: |
  Determine project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and whether UI/UX is involved, then load the
  corresponding PRD, architecture, FE specs, existing codebases, and infrastructure docs. Confirm
  with the user whether to run the checklist interactively or independently, and cite evidence for
  every validation.
report_instructions: |
  Produce a PDM validation report with executive summary (project type, readiness, go/no-go,
  skipped sections), project-specific analysis, risk assessment, MVP completeness, and
  implementation readiness highlights.
sections:
  - id: SETUP
    title: Project Setup & Initialization
    llm_hint: |
      Ensure the foundational environment matches project type—greenfield needs clean scaffolding; brownfield must integrate safely with existing systems.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: Project scaffolding is defined (template usage or from-scratch steps, README, repo setup).
        condition: greenfield
      - text: Existing system analysis and integration points are documented with rollback coverage.
        condition: brownfield
      - text: Local development environment setup, tooling, dependency install steps, and configs are clear.
      - text: Core dependencies are listed early with package management strategy and version constraints.
      - text: Compatibility with the existing stack is validated when layering onto brownfield systems.
        condition: brownfield
  - id: INFRASTRUCTURE
    title: Infrastructure & Deployment
    llm_hint: |
      Infrastructure must precede usage: databases, APIs, deployment, and testing environments need sequencing, especially to avoid brownfield regressions.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: Database/data-store setup (selection, schema, migrations, seed data) is planned before use, with migration/compat risks handled.
      - text: API/service configuration covers frameworks, auth, middleware, and compatibility with existing systems where applicable.
      - text: Deployment pipeline (CI/CD, IaC, env configs, strategies) is defined with downtime mitigation for brownfield.
      - text: Testing infrastructure (frameworks, environments, mocks) is in place, including regression coverage for legacy behavior.
  - id: EXTERNAL-DEPS
    title: External Dependencies & Integrations
    llm_hint: |
      External services, APIs, and infra dependencies often block teams—confirm credentials, sequencing, and backward compatibility.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: Third-party services have account/key setup steps, credential storage, fallbacks, and compatibility checks for existing integrations.
      - text: External API integrations define endpoints, auth, limits, failure handling, and maintain current dependencies.
      - text: Infrastructure services (cloud resources, DNS, messaging, CDNs) are provisioned before use and preserve existing setups when required.
  - id: UI-UX
    title: UI/UX Considerations
    llm_hint: |
      Run this section only when UI/UX is in scope; confirm design systems, frontend pipelines, and UX flows align with accessibility and existing experiences.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: UI framework, design system, styling approach, responsive strategy, and accessibility requirements are established.
        condition: ui
      - text: Frontend infrastructure (build pipeline, asset strategy, testing, workflow) is prepared, retaining consistency with existing UI when relevant.
        condition: ui
      - text: User journeys, navigation, error/loading states, and validation patterns are mapped, preserving prior workflows on brownfield fronts.
        condition: ui
  - id: RESPONSIBILITY
    title: User/Agent Responsibility
    llm_hint: |
      Assign human-only tasks to users and technical work to agents so ownership is unambiguous.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: Human-only activities (account creation, purchases, credential provision) are assigned to users.
      - text: Code/config/testing responsibilities are allocated to dev agents with automation opportunities noted.
  - id: SEQUENCING
    title: Feature Sequencing & Dependencies
    llm_hint: |
      Validate functional, technical, and cross-epic dependencies so the plan respects critical paths and protects existing behavior.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: Functional dependencies are sequenced logically (shared components, auth before protected flows, etc.).
      - text: Technical dependencies (services, libraries, data models, APIs) are built before consumers rely on them.
      - text: Cross-epic dependencies ensure later epics rely only on completed earlier work while delivering incremental value.
      - text: Existing functionality remains intact throughout the sequence for brownfield efforts.
        condition: brownfield
  - id: RISK
    title: Risk Management
    llm_hint: |
      Brownfield projects demand pessimistic risk analysis—identify breaking changes, rollback readiness, and user impact mitigations.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: Breaking change risks (functionality, migrations, APIs, performance, security) are logged with mitigations.
        condition: brownfield
      - text: Rollback strategy covers per-story procedures, feature flags, backups, monitoring, and triggers.
        condition: brownfield
      - text: User impact mitigation (workflow analysis, communication, training, support, data migration) is defined.
        condition: brownfield
  - id: MVP
    title: MVP Scope Alignment
    llm_hint: |
      Reaffirm that planned work strictly serves MVP goals, with brownfield enhancements justified and user journeys complete.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: All PRD core goals are addressed without scope creep, with enhancements justified for brownfield complexity.

      - text: Technical constraints, NFRs, and compatibility requirements are satisfied.
  - id: DOCUMENTATION
    title: Documentation & Handoff

      Good documentation keeps teams aligned; ensure dev/user docs, integration notes, and LLM-ready context packets exist.
    required: true
    items:
      - text: Developer documentation (API refs, setup instructions, architecture decisions, patterns) is current, with integration points detailed for brownfield.
      - text: User documentation (guides, messaging, onboarding) is updated when user-facing behavior changes.
      - text: Knowledge transfer artifacts capture existing system context, integration details, review plans, operations handoff, and historical rationale.
      - text: Handoff packages are optimized for LLM agents with concise, labeled context and minimal excess narrative.
  - id: POST-MVP
    title: Post-MVP Considerations
    llm_hint: |

      - text: Future enhancements are decoupled from MVP scope with extensibility points noted.
      - text: Technical debt and reuse patterns (especially for integrations) are documented.

    items:
      - text: Compile the executive summary (project type, readiness percentage, go/no-go, blocking issues, skipped sections).
      - text: Document project-type analysis (setup/completeness/timeline for greenfield; integration risk/impact/rollback/user disruption for brownfield).
