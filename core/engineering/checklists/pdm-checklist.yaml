title: Product Development Master Checklist
purpose: Validate project plans before execution across project types.
agent: pdm
context:
  notes: Detect project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and UI scope; skip items not applicable and note skips.
init_instructions: |
  Determine project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and whether UI/UX is involved, then load the
  corresponding PRD, architecture, FE specs, existing codebases, and infrastructure docs. Confirm
  with the user whether to run the checklist interactively or independently, and cite evidence for
  every validation.
report_instructions: |
  Produce a PDM validation report with executive summary (project type, readiness, go/no-go,
  skipped sections), project-specific analysis, risk assessment, MVP completeness, and
  implementation readiness highlights.
sections:
