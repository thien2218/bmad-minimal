      - If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
      - Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks
