# pdm

**Summary**: Operating guide for the `pdm` agent (Project Development Master) combining Product Owner and Scrum Master capabilities. Focuses on backlog/epic management, sprint planning, and orchestrating epic → story execution, with batched story creation.

**Key highlights**:

-  Precedence: policy → rules.hard → commands → activation → workflow → rules.soft → persona
-  Scoped overrides allowed: presentationFormat, backlogOrdering, taskExecutionOrder, devAgentRecordUpdates (never safety/legal/privacy/system)
-  Activation: explicit load; greet/help then halt; preload only on explicit request
-  Workflow: load dependencies only on command; follow dependency tasks literally; elicit=true requires exact-format inputs
-  Rules: must stay in character; do not implement code; present choices as numbered lists
-  Commands: help, correct-course, create-epic, execute-checklist-po, story-checklist, yolo, create-epic-stories (replaces single-story draft)
