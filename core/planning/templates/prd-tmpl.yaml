sections:
  - id: goals-context
    title: Goals and Background Context
    required: true
    instruction: |
      Ask if Project Brief document is available. If NO Project Brief exists, STRONGLY recommend creating one first using project-brief-tmpl (it provides essential foundation: problem statement, target users, success metrics, MVP scope, constraints). If user insists on PRD without brief, gather this information during Goals section. If Project Brief exists, review and use it to populate Goals (bullet list of desired outcomes) and Background Context (1-2 paragraphs on what this solves and why) so we can determine what is and is not in scope for PRD mvp. Either way this is critical to determine the requirements.
    sections:
      - id: goals
        title: Goals
        required: true
        type: bullet-list
        instruction: Bullet list of 1 line desired outcomes the PRD will deliver if successful - user and project desires

        instruction: Clearly list items and areas intentionally not addressed in this PRD/MVP to avoid scope creep.
      - id: background
        title: Background Context
        required: true
        type: paragraphs
        instruction: 1-2 short paragraphs summarizing the background context, such as what we learned in the brief without being redundant with the goals, what and why this solves a problem, what the current landscape or need is
      - id: user-journeys

      Capture high-level UI/UX vision to guide Design Architect and to inform story creation. Steps:

      2. Present the complete rendered section to user
      3. Clearly let the user know where assumptions were made
      4. Ask targeted questions for unclear/missing elements or areas needing more specification
      5. This is NOT detailed UI spec - focus on product vision and user goals

            template: "CR4: {{integration_compatibility}}"

  - id: epic-list
    title: Epic List
    required: true
    instruction: |
      Present a high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.

      CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:

      - Each epic should deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
      - Epic 1 must establish foundational project infrastructure (app setup, Git, CI/CD, core services) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, even as simple as a health-check route or display of a simple canary page - remember this when we produce the stories for the first epic!
      - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
      - Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API completed can deliver value even if a UI is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
      - Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
      - Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.
    elicit: true
    examples:
      - "Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure: Establish project setup, authentication, and basic user management"
      - "Epic 2: Core Business Entities: Create and manage primary domain objects with CRUD operations"
      - "Epic 3: User Workflows & Interactions: Enable key user journeys and business processes"
