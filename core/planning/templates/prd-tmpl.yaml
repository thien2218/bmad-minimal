    title: Goals and Background Context
    required: true
    instruction: |
      Ask if Project Brief document is available. If NO Project Brief exists, STRONGLY recommend creating one first using project-brief-tmpl (it provides essential foundation: problem statement, target users, success metrics, MVP scope, constraints). If user insists on PRD without brief, gather this information during Goals section. If Project Brief exists, review and use it to populate Goals (bullet list of desired outcomes) and Background Context (1-2 paragraphs on what this solves and why) so we can determine what is and is not in scope for PRD mvp. Either way this is critical to determine the requirements. Include Change Log table.

      3. Clearly let the user know where assumptions were made
      4. Ask targeted questions for unclear/missing elements or areas needing more specification
      5. This is NOT detailed UI spec - focus on product vision and user goals

  - id: technical-assumptions
    title: Technical Assumptions
    required: true
    instruction: |
      Gather technical decisions that will guide the Architect. Steps:

      1. Check if {@docs.files.codingStandards} or an attached coding-standards file exists - use it to pre-populate choices
      2. Ask user about: languages, frameworks, starter templates, libraries, APIs, deployment targets
      3. For unknowns, offer guidance based on project goals and MVP scope
      4. Document ALL technical choices with rationale (why this choice fits the project)
      5. These become constraints for the Architect - be specific and complete
    elicit: true
    choices:
      repository: [Monorepo, Polyrepo]
      architecture: [Monolith, Microservices, Serverless]
      testing: [Unit Only, Unit + Integration, Full Testing Pyramid]

        title: Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
        required: true
        instruction: Throughout the entire process of drafting this document, if any other technical assumptions are raised or discovered appropriate for the architect, add them here as additional bulleted items

  - id: epic-list
    title: Epic List
    required: true
    instruction: |
      Present a high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.

      CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:

      - Each epic should deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
      - Epic 1 must establish foundational project infrastructure (app setup, Git, CI/CD, core services) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, even as simple as a health-check route or display of a simple canary page - remember this when we produce the stories for the first epic!
      - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
      - Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API completed can deliver value even if a UI is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
      - Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
      - Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.
    elicit: true
    examples:
      - "Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure: Establish project setup, authentication, and basic user management"
      - "Epic 2: Core Business Entities: Create and manage primary domain objects with CRUD operations"
      - "Epic 3: User Workflows & Interactions: Enable key user journeys and business processes"
