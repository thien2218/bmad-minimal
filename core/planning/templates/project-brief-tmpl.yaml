        This template guides creation of a comprehensive Project Brief that serves as the foundational input for product development.

        Start by asking the user which mode they prefer:

        1. **Interactive Mode** - Work through each section collaboratively
        2. **YOLO Mode** - Generate complete draft for review and refinement

        Before beginning, understand what inputs are available (brainstorming results, market research, competitive analysis, initial ideas) and gather project context.
