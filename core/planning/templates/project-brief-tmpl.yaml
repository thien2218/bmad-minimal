      This template guides creation of a comprehensive Project Brief that serves as the foundational input for product development.

      Start by asking the user which mode they prefer:

      1. **Interactive Mode** - Work through each section collaboratively
      2. **YOLO Mode** - Generate complete draft for review and refinement
